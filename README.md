# Simplified Car Board Simulator

## Project Description

I am developing a simplified car dashboard simulator with three functions: simulating indexing with two LEDs, turning the high beam on and off, and simulating the car's steering. The project is powered by an Arduino Uno and programmed using the Arduino IDE.

## Schematics

- 1 capacitor
- 2 index LEDs
- 1 light LED
- 1 push button
- 2 potentiometers
- 4 resistances
- 10 long jump wires
- Short jump wires
- Rigid wires
- 2 breadboards (only 1 is necessary)
- 1 Arduino
- 1 Arduino cable (when not receiving current from a battery)
